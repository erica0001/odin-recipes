      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 block tofu extra firm tofu (about 350g), cut into thin squares</li>
          <li>1 tbsp miso paste</li>
          <li>1/2 tbsp maple syrup or agave nectar</li>
          <li>1 tbsp rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar</li>
          <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
          <li>1/2 tbsp garlic minced (2 cloves) or garlic powder (optional)</li>
          <li>1 tbsp oil for cooking</li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Start by preparing the tofu. If desired, freeze the tofu and then defrost it to achieve a meatier texture. In all cases, cut the block of extra-firm tofu into thin squares or any preferred size.</li>
          <li>Heat oil on a large non-stick pan on medium-high heat.</li>
          <li>Once the pan is hot, add the tofu squares and cook on each side until they turn golden and slightly crispy. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
          <li>Prepare the miso sauce: In a small bowl, mix together the miso paste, minced garlic (or garlic powder), soy sauce, rice vinegar (or apple cider vinegar), and maple syrup (or agave nectar) until well combined.</li>
          <li>Once the tofu is cooked and golden, reduce the heat to low. Pour the miso sauce over the tofu in the pan and stir to coat the tofu evenly, flipping over the tofu a few times. Allow the tofu to cook slightly in the sauce on low heat to enhance the flavour.</li>
          <li>Once the tofu is fully coated with the miso sauce, turn off the heat.</li>
          <li>Serve the miso tofu on top of rice, as a delicious protein source to any meal or make a Miso Tofu Bowl</li>
