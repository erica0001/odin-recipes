                <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>

            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>First, prepare your tofu for your bok choy stir fry. Feel free to cook your rice unless you have leftover rice to use.</li>
                <li>For this recipe, I cut tofu into bite-sized cubes and add them into a bowl, along with soy sauce and roasted sesame oil. Mix well and let it marinate for around 5 minutes while preparing the other ingredients. For better results, use frozen then thawed tofu as the marinade will be soaked up very easily.</li>
                <li>While tofu is marinating, you can prepare and chop your bok choy. Prepare baby bok choy by washing and cutting the leaves as desired.</li>
                <li>Mix together the sauce ingredients in a bowl and prepare everything else.</li>
                <li>Once the tofu is marinated, sprinkle on some cornstarch and toss it to coat.</li>
                <li>In a large non-stick wok or pan, add about 1 tbsp of oil and add the coated tofu pieces (try to separate them so they are not touching each other). Cook evenly on each side until golden brown, for around 5-8 minutes.</li>
                <li>Set the tofu aside and in the same pan, add 1/2 tbsp of oil and cook onions, minced garlic and minced ginger for about a minute. Add in baby bok choy and sauté until just wilted.</li>
                <li>Add the cooked tofu back in, along with the sauce. Mix well and let it cook together for a couple of minutes.</li>
                <li>In the meantime, prepare a starch slurry by mixing together cornstarch with water (exact measurements in recipe card).</li>
                <li>Turn the heat to low on the wok and slowly pour in your starch slurry while mixing. Mix until the liquid begins to thicken into a sauce.</li>
                <li>Turn the heat off and top with green onion and sesame seeds. Serve on top of rice!</li>
            </ol>
